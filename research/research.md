My interests lie at the intersection of  Natural Language Processing and and Machine Learning. In addition, I enjoy problems in discrete mathematics, probability theory, and number theory. Here, you can find material relevant to my published research and research in progress. Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in anything I am currently working.
