- **[On Marshall Hallâ€™s Conjecture and Gaps Between Integer Points on Mordell Elliptic Curves](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.0078.pdf){:target="_blank"}**: [CMPS203, Spring 18'] <br>
For a non-square positive integer x, let k_x denote the distance between x^3 and the perfect square closest to x^3. A conjecture of Marshall Hall states that the ratios r_x = (x^(1/2))/k_x, are bounded above. (Elkies has shown that any such bound must exceed 46.6.) Let {x(n)} be the sequence of "Hall numbers": positive non-square integers for which r_x(n) exceeds 1. Extensive computer searches have identified approximately 50 Hall numbers. (It can be proved that infinitely many exist.) In this paper we study the minimum gap between consecutive Hall numbers. We prove that for all n, x(n + 1) - x(n) > (1/5)x(n)^(1/6), with stronger gaps applying when x(n) is close to perfect even or odd squares (approximately x(n)^(1/3) or x(n)^(1/4), respectively). This result has obvious implications for the minimum "horizontal gap" (and hence straight line and arc distance) between integer points (whose x-coordinates exceed k^2) on the Mordell elliptic curves x^3 - y^2 = k, a question that does not appear to have been addressed.

-	**[Ideology-Backed Stance Classification](/files/cmps-245-winter.pdf){:target="_blank"}**: [CMPS245, Winter 17'] <br>
The determination of stance in two-sided discussions/debates in online debate forums is a new and interesting problem in opinion mining. We target the task of classifying stance in ideological debates on online debate forums,
and this is a rather challenging problem due to the nature of debate setting and the language used. Previous work has introduced the notion of using ideology as an inter-post, extra-linguistic constraint which are implemented using Integer Linear Programming. In this work, we seek to improve an approach on jointly-modeling disagreement and stance in online debate forums by integrating ideology as a latent variable in the joint model. We show improvement of a few percentage points over the baseline set by \cite{sridhar:acl15}. Additionally, we have also created a new ideology corpus of around 1.5 million tweets by 645 official members of the U.S. Congress.
