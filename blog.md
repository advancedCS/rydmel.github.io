On average, how long do we need to roll a die and sum the rolls until the sum is prime? Moreover, what if we
roll until the sum is composite?




Find the number of ordered 64-tuples (x0, x1,..., x63)
such that x0, x1,..., x63 are distinct elements of
{1,2,...,2017} and
x0 +x1 +2x2 +3x3 +···+63x63
is divisible by 2017.
